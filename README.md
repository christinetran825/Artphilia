# Artphilia
There are countless artists in the world. This is especially true for non-musician artists. Becoming a fan of these artists is easy: you can follow the artist on social media, on their personal website, and by buying their works. With so many artists, how can you keep track of every one?

Welcome to Artphilia, an app that helps you keep a record of non-musician artists that you like. You can easily keep a record of the artist's works that you already own or wish to own, and get in touch with fellow fans. You may even find a new artist to follow.
